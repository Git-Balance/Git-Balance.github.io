				<p>During the summer of 2024, I was accepted into the San Diego
					Supercomputer Center’s (SDSC) Research Experience for High School
					Students’ (REHS) summer internship program at UCSD. My job was to review
					and debug the Jupyter notebooks that train new Expanse Supercomputer
					users.</p>

				<p>In 11th grade Biotech, I had to choose a biology related problem and
					find a solution using technology and skills learned in class. I chose
					treating Diabetes Insipidus, a condition where the body does not retain
					water properly (this was a condition I was tested for before I was tested for celiac disease). I came up with a protocol to create bacteria that
					generates vasopressin, a hormone that people with Diabetes Insipidus
					often do not produce properly, by inserting a plasmid with the
					vasopressin gene, then harvesting the vasopressin from the bacteria.
					This involves CRISPR technology. While originally this was a group
					project, I chose to work on this project on my own.</p>
				<p>While working on the project, I realized that there not a way of
					detecting osmolarity levels in a person quickly enough to respond to
					changes in their environment. I suspect that hypothetically supraoptic
					nuclei cells, which detect osmolarity, could be grown and used to
					monitor osmolarity levels; I did not have the time to research this for
					my project.</p>

				<p>Using <a href="https://haqr.eu/tinyrenderer/">the TinyRenderer course
						by Dmitry V. Sokolov</a>, I am making a renderer that turns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">wavefront .obj
						files</a>
					into a 2d image of a model. The course uses C++ and a library
					that can create and make simple edits to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">TGA
						files</a>;
					everything else (drawing lines, loading files, etc.) had to be coded
					from scratch. I restarted the course multiple times as I gained
					programming and math experience.</p>

				<figure class="image-center image-size-100">
					<img src="https://github.com/Git-Balance/pygame_asteroids/blob/main/display/example.png?raw=true" alt="asteroids">
				</figure>
				<p>Following <a href="https://realpython.com/asteroids-game-python/">this tutorial</a>,
					I created an asteroids style game during Independent Study in 8th grade.
					I used Python and PyGame. The project is incomplete.</p>
				<h2 id="raylib">Raylib</h2>
				<p>Raylib is a library used for game development. It has functions for
					creating windows, getting input, drawing images, and more. I used it to
					make game prototypes in C++ to learn more about the language.</p>

				<p>A sand simulation. Every step, sand falls downward. I learned what
					not to do with objects in C++, and I plan to redo this project using
					what I learned.</p>

				<p>An original mini game where the goal is to move the player in the
					spaces between the falling objects. The player moves along the
					horizontal axis. This used C++.</p>

				<p>A Java simulation of predator/prey relationships. This was inspired
					by a lab done in my Biology class.</p>
				<p>I made this project to practice Java.</p>
				<h2 id="programming-on-android">Programming on Android</h2>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/Git-Balance/termux-android-public-notes">Link to GitHub Repository</a></p>
				<p>Termux is an app on Android that can run a Linux terminal. This allows
					me to use desktop Linux software like Vim, Git, and cmake on Android.
					This let me program on Android (in this case, on Kindle Fire).</p>
				<p>Termux does not support graphical applications by default. I had to
					create a VNC server inside of Termux, start a window manager (like i3),
					then use a VNC client app on Android to connect to the server inside of
					Termux.</p>
				<h2 id="linux-customization">Linux Customization</h2>
				<p>I customize the applications I use in Linux. I backup and sync the
					files usually with Git and GitHub</p>
				<h3 id="neovim-config">Neovim Config</h3>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/Git-Balance/nvim-config">Link to GitHub repository</a></p>
				<p>Neovim (a fork of Vim) is my primary code and text editor. I
					configured it using <a href="https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim">kickstart.nvim</a>
					as
					a base.</p>
				<figure class="image-center image-size-100">

					<img src="https://github.com/Git-Balance/rofi/blob/main/display/example.png?raw=true" alt="rofi">
				</figure>
				<p>I used i3, a basic window manager that requires the user to
					add/customize most of the basic features.</p>
				<p>I used polybar as the bottom panel, and used Rofi as an app
					launcher.</p>
				<h3 id="nix-and-nixos">Nix and NixOS</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/Git-Balance/nixos-public">NixOS configuration on GitHub</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/Git-Balance/latino-nix">GitHub link for latino on Nix</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>NixOS is a Linux distribution that uses the Nix language to configure
					itself and install/configure packages. I used this as my OS on my laptop
					for almost a year. I used it because it could be configured almost
					entirely through code; it made package management simpler. I stopped
					using it because it could only be configured through the Nix language;
					Nix introduced a level of abstraction that made it hard to debug
					problems and make changes quickly. Additionally, the things I learnt
					about Nix and NixOS could not be applied outside of the Nix
					ecosystem.</p>
				<p>On NixOS, I needed to add extra configuration to my programming
					projects; many of the projects here like Raylib Sand include a
					<code>shell.nix</code>
					file.</p>
				<h2 id="ics-to-google-classroom">ICS to Google Classroom</h2>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/Git-Balance/ICS-to-GClassroom-Public">Link to GitHub Repository</a></p>
				<p>One of my middle school teachers posted their assignments on
					iCalendar; my other teachers posted their assignments on Google
					Classroom. Since iCalendar lets users export their calendars as ICS
					files, I created a script that generates Google Classroom assignments
					from ICS files. This let me use Google Classroom as my only todo list
					for school work at the time.</p>

				<h2 id="computer-science-independent-study">Computer Science Independent
					Study</h2>
				<p><a href="./Mr Collins Independet Study Letter.pdf" target="_blank">Proof of completion</a></p>
				<p>During 8th grade, I was allowed to use my elective for independent
					study to take online courses via Coursera, including: Crash Course in
					Python, Using Python to Interact with Operating Systems, Introduction to
					Git and GitHub, Troubleshooting and Debugging Techniques.</p>
